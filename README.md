# Weather Dashboard

## Description

The purpose of this project was to utilize a server-side API to retrieve and display the weather forecast when a location is searched for. This is useful for a user to be able to plan their day accordingly and plan upcoming travel accordingly. Over the course of building this project, I became comfortable with creating fetch requests and extracting and manipulating desired data points.
